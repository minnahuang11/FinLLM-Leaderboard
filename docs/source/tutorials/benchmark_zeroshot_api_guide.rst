This guide shows how to benchmark an OpenAI model in a **Zero-Shot** setting:

1. **Install** the necessary libraries.  
2. **Load** your OpenAI API key.  
3. **Prompt** the model in a zero-shot manner for each question in a CSV file.  
4. **Save** model outputs in a new column named ``generated_answer`` in the resulting CSV.

Prerequisites
-------------
1. **config.json** containing your keys. For this tutorial, only ``openai_api_key`` is actually used, but you can also store other keys for future expansions:

   .. code-block:: json

       {
         "openai_api_key": "sk-your-openai-key-here",
         "mistral_api_key": "ignored_for_this_tutorial",
         "together_ai_api_key": "ignored_for_this_tutorial"
       }

   .. note::
      This JSON file holds your API keys. Only the ``openai_api_key`` is used here, but additional keys can be added for expanding your use to other models in the future.

2. A CSV file named ``questions.csv`` with at least a ``question`` column, columns for answer choices, and a column for the expected answer. Here's an example:

   .. list-table:: questions.csv
      :header-rows: 1
      :widths: 20 20 20 20 20

      * - question
        - choiceA
        - choiceB
        - choiceC
        - expected_answer
      * - "Sammy Sneadle, CFA, is the founder of the Everglades Fund. The question is: how did he violate the standard by not disclosing back-tested data?"
        - "A. He did not disclose the use of back-tested data."
        - "B. He failed to deduct fees before returns."
        - "C. He did not show a weighted composite of similar portfolios."
        - "A"

   .. note::
      This table provides a visual example of the CSV format required for the tutorial. Each row contains the question, three answer choices, and the expected answer.

3. Install the following libraries:

   .. code-block:: bash

      pip install openai==0.28.0 \
                  pandas \
                  tqdm \
                  torch

   .. note::
      These commands install the OpenAI library (for API access), pandas (for CSV handling), tqdm (for displaying progress), and torch (for any PyTorch functionality).

Tutorial
--------
1. Import Libraries

   .. code-block:: python

      import os
      import json
      import pandas as pd
      from tqdm import tqdm
      import openai
      import torch

   .. note::
      This code imports all necessary libraries: `os` and `json` for file handling, `pandas` for data manipulation, `tqdm` for progress tracking, `openai` for OpenAI API interaction, and `torch` in case PyTorch functionality is needed.

2. Load Keys

   .. code-block:: python
      
      with open("config.json", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
          config = json.load(f)

      # Required for OpenAI
      openai.api_key = config["openai_api_key"]

   .. note::
      This snippet loads your API keys from the `config.json` file and sets the OpenAI API key to allow authenticated API calls.

3. Define a Zero-Shot Inference Function

   .. code-block:: python

      def generate_multiple_choice_response(
          question,
          choiceA,
          choiceB,
          choiceC,
          system_prompt=(
              "You are a CFA (chartered financial analyst) taking a test to "
              "evaluate your knowledge of finance. You will be given a question along "
              "with three possible answers (A, B, and C). Provide only the letter "
              "for the correct choice (A, B, or C)."
          ),
          model_name="gpt-4",
          temperature=0,
          max_tokens=128
      ):
          """
          Generate a zero-shot response using OpenAI's ChatCompletion API.
          
          :param str question: The actual question from the user.
          :param str choiceA: Choice A for the question.
          :param str choiceB: Choice B for the question.
          :param str choiceC: Choice C for the question.
          :param str system_prompt: General instructions or domain expertise the model follows.
          :param str model_name: LLM name, e.g. "gpt-3.5-turbo" or "gpt-4".
          :param float temperature: Affects randomness of output.
          :param int max_tokens: Maximum length for generated response.
          :return: The model's generated answer.
          """
          try:
              user_prompt = (
                  f"Question:\n{question}\n\n"
                  f"{choiceA}\n{choiceB}\n{choiceC}\n\n"
                  "Which choice is correct (A, B, or C)?"
              )
              response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
                  model=model_name,
                  messages=[
                      {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
                      {"role": "user", "content": user_prompt}
                  ],
                  temperature=temperature,
                  max_tokens=max_tokens
              )
              return response["choices"][0]["message"]["content"].strip()
          except Exception as e:
              print(f"Error: {e}")
              return "Error generating response"

   .. note::
      This function constructs a complete prompt combining your question and answer choices, sends it to the OpenAI API using the provided model, and returns the model's answer. If an error occurs, it prints the error and returns an error message.

4. Read Questions from CSV, Prompt the Model, and Save Results

   .. code-block:: python

      def run_zero_shot(
          input_csv="questions.csv",
          output_csv="gpt_4_answers.csv",
          model_name="gpt-4"
      ):
          """
          Reads a CSV of questions, prompts GPT-4 to answer them in a zero-shot setting,
          and writes answers to 'generated_answer' in the output CSV.
          
          :param str input_csv: Path to the CSV file containing questions.
          :param str output_csv: Path for the CSV file with the model's answers.
          :param str model_name: The model we are testing.
          """
          df = pd.read_csv(input_csv)
          answers = []
          for _, row in tqdm(df.iterrows(), total=len(df), desc="Generating MC Answers"):
              q_text = row["question"]
              a_text = row["choiceA"]
              b_text = row["choiceB"]
              c_text = row["choiceC"]
              answer = generate_multiple_choice_response(
                  question=q_text,
                  choiceA=a_text,
                  choiceB=b_text,
                  choiceC=c_text,
                  model_name=model_name,
                  temperature=0.0,
                  max_tokens=128
              )
              answer = answer.strip().upper()[:1]
              answers.append(answer)
          df["generated_answer"] = answers
          df.to_csv(output_csv, index=False)
          print(f"Results saved to {output_csv}")

   .. note::
      This block reads your CSV containing questions and their respective answer choices, then iterates over each row to generate an answer using the earlier function. The generated answers are saved back into a new column in a new CSV file.

5. Score the Model's Responses

   .. code-block:: python

      def score_multiple_choice(
          input_csv="gpt_4_answers.csv",
          output_csv="gpt_4_answers_scored.csv"
      ):
          """
          Loads the CSV with 'generated_answer' and 'expected_answer', and scores the answer as
          'T' if correct or 'F' if incorrect.
          
          :param str input_csv: Path to the CSV file with the model's answers.
          :param str output_csv: Path to save the scored CSV.
          """
          df = pd.read_csv(input_csv)
          if "generated_answer" not in df.columns:
              print("No 'generated_answer' column found. Cannot score.")
              return
          if "expected_answer" not in df.columns:
              print("No 'expected_answer' column found. Cannot score.")
              return
          accuracy_scores = []
          for _, row in df.iterrows():
              expected = str(row["expected_answer"]).strip().upper()
              generated = str(row["generated_answer"]).strip().upper()
              accuracy_scores.append('T' if generated == expected else 'F')
          df["accuracy_score"] = accuracy_scores
          df.to_csv(output_csv, index=False)
          print(f"Scored results saved to {output_csv}")

   .. note::
      Here, the function compares the generated answer with the expected answer from the CSV, marks each as correct ('T') or incorrect ('F'), and saves the updated scores in a new CSV file.

6. Run the Inference and Scoring

   .. code-block:: python

      if __name__ == "__main__":
          # 1. Run the multiple-choice question inference
          run_zero_shot(
              input_csv="questions.csv",
              output_csv="gpt_4_answers.csv",
              model_name="gpt-4"
          )
          # 2. Score the model responses
          score_multiple_choice(
              input_csv="gpt_4_answers.csv",
              output_csv="gpt_4_answers_scored.csv"
          )

   .. note::
      This main block executes the workflow: it first generates answers for each question, then scores these answers, saving both outputs to CSV files.

Running the Tutorial
--------------------
1. Make sure ``config.json`` contains your OpenAI API key.
2. Place your questions in ``questions.csv``.
3. Install dependencies as listed above.
4. Save all the code to one file called ``zero_shot.py``.
5. Run ``python zero_shot.py``.

Key Takeaways
-------------
This tutorial demonstrates how to benchmark an OpenAI model in a zero-shot setting for financial tasks. This tutoirals teaches you how to install dependencies, load API keys, process a CSV file of questions, generate responses, and score those responses. Understanding parameters such as temperature, max_tokens, and system_prompt is important for obtaining accurate results.

Notes that you can refer back to later
--------------------------------------

- **Zero-shot** means that you prompt a model with just the question and no examples.
- **temperature** determines the randomness of the model response. The closer to 0, the more deterministic and consistent the model response is.
- **max_tokens** determines the maximum length of the output of the model.
- **system_prompt** determines the behavior/domain context the model should follow.
- **prompt** is the actual question the user gives to the model. It is also called a user prompt.
