# Comparison of Task Performance on CodeLlama-7B

## Results Overview
The model's performance on **NER** showed an entity F1 score of **0.0851**, which is relatively low, indicating difficulty in correctly identifying named entities. For **FinRED**, a financial relation extraction task, the precision (**0.0009**), recall (**0.0022**), and F1-score (**0.0013**) were extremely low, suggesting that the model struggles with this domain. The **FINER-ORD** task resulted in an error, indicating an issue with processing or a fundamental limitation of the model on this dataset.

## Summary
Overall, CodeLlama-7B appears to struggle with these NLP tasks, especially financial-related ones. The low F1 scores and errors suggest that the model may not be well-suited for tasks requiring domain-specific understanding or structured information extraction. Further fine-tuning or task-specific adaptation may be needed to improve its performance in these areas.
